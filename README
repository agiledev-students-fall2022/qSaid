Description of the project:
Our main aim is to cater to the needs of autistic people by providing a quantum approach for early diagnosis of autism and allocate resources efficiently amongst people. 
Finding accurate, reliable and timely diagnosis for autism is a huge challenge.  Highly trained clinical experts are in short supply globally especially in the developing countries. Treatment centers are often not optimally located towards ensuring adequate patient access. 
We want every patient to have easy, affordable and timely access to treatment and by using AI powered screening tools to allow early diagnosis without leaving your house. These two approaches can potentially have a significant impact in detecting and treating autism. 
 If significant changes are observed, our approach could also be extended to other neurodivergent disorders.
